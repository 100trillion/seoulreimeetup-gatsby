## Welcome to the Seoul Real Estate Investing Meetup


The Seoul Real Estate Investing Meetup is a community of real estate investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals based in South Korea. Our mission is to nurture a community of like-minded people for the purposes of education, networking, growth, and financial freedom.

We organize and host educational seminars featuring guest speakers with specialist knowledge. Past speakers have included a Fortune 500 company, a high-ranking public official, an urban planning and retail development consultant, a sustainable transport expert, as well as a number of PropTech startups and experienced private real estate investors. We also host panel discussions, real estate tours and networking events, including happy hours and dinner-and-learn events.

One of the best investments you can make as a real estate investor is in strengthening your network. I’m constantly amazed by the ROI (return on investment) I get just from reaching out to people, connecting, and asking to hear their stories. Last night, The Seoul Real Estate Investing Meetup posted on Reddit about our upcoming Saturday Meetup. (H/t to Jean-Luc for getting it all set up!)

What we have going on out here is so unique that I want to give as many people the opportunity to join us as possible. I know how hard it was to get started investing on my own (and I had a partner too!) and how much easier it has been now that I have a great network of supporters, motivators, teachers, and learners.

Our random post on Reddit helped us connect with yet another real estate investor who is investing in Korea, Sean Walker. According to [his website](http://www.thedamyanghouse.com/p/blog-page_19.html),  "He is currently a Visiting Professor in the English Education Department at Chonnam National University. "

Sean was kind enough to share his real estate adventures in Korea on a Reddit post. His journey began several years ago when he and his wife decided to buy their own land and build a house in a bamboo forest. Sounds like the start of a great movie, right? Of course, they faced countless naysayers who said it couldn’t be done, and Sean will be the first to admit that it wasn’t exactly a smooth ride.

If you want to see the results, check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedamyanghouse.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Damyang House</a> website. If you want to learn more about how he did it, see this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2i9krv/airbnb_hostrenovating_countryside_house/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post</a>. And to check out the Seoul Real Estate Investing Meetup’s Reddit post (and contribute), click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/3ola4m/any_real_estate_investors_living_in_korea_and/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (as of this writing, we have 38 comments).

Although I don’t know Sean personally, I know there are dozens like him out in Korea – the entrepreneurial types who get an idea stuck in their head and just can’t seem to let it go. They pursue it despite what the pessimists around them say. I admire those types, and I know quite a few of them in our meetup.

Of course, the journey is a lot easier when you have people to share it with – people who will support you, encourage you, guide you, and even commiserate with you throughout the process.

Come join us on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Seoul-REI-Meetup/events/225572865/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday, October 17, from 1 to 3 PM at TOZ Gangnam</a>.

Don’t let that beautiful, unique dream of yours fade away. As a wise man once said,  "You’ll never regret the dreams you went for and didn’t quite reach. Only the ones you never tried. "

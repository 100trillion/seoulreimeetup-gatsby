The lecture, which was held at <a target="_blank" href="http://10k.asia/places_korea/" rel="noopener noreferrer">10K City Hall</a> near Seoul Plaza and Seoul City Hall, was attended by an eclectic audience of more than 40 people interested in real estate investment as well as a Korea Times reporter. We were also joined by 777 _Periscope_ viewers as they tuned in to a live broadcast of the event.

During the presentation, Nikola detailed the history of Seoul’s growth as well as public infrastructure and transportation developments looking forward. Nikola was able to pull all of this information from the media, online communities, direct sources, official plans, and experts to bring our members a high-quality, information-packed presentation. The presentation was followed by a question-and-answer session with Jeff Yu, a bilingual real estate agent operating in the Yongsan area.

During their presentation, Jacob and Victoria explained how they&#8217;ve been able to use the jeonse system to acquire a number of properties in Sokcho and, more recently, Hongdae in Seoul.

## WHAT IS JEONSE?

_Jeonse_ (전세) is a tenancy agreement in which the tenant pays the landlord a refundable deposit&#8211;jeonse&#8211;of approximately two-thirds of the property&#8217;s market value in order to live in that property &#8220;rent-free&#8221; for at least two years. This kind of tenancy agreement is unique to Korea.

## WHAT IS THE JEONSE STRATEGY?

The jeonse strategy makes use of the the jeonse system. It involves using money from jeonse tenants&#8211;other people&#8217;s money (OPM)&#8211;to buy investment properties.&nbsp;Check out [this article](http://seoulreimeetup.com/korea/how-to-buy-an-apartment-in-korea-for-5000) for more information about the jeonse strategy.

## ASYMMETRIC RETURN

Most investments involve an element of risk, and the jeonse strategy is no different. But as Jacob and Victoria were able to show us, it&#8217;s possible to minimize risk while at the same time maximizing returns. By doing this, they are able to create an asymmetric return. Here are a few things you can do to create this:

  * As the jeonse strategy involves an element of speculation,&nbsp;invest in steadily appreciating real estate markets. Sokcho was identified by Jacob and Victoria as an appreciating market for a number of reasons, including: 
      * Sokcho&#8217;s proximity to both the East Sea and Seorak mountain, one of Korea&#8217;s most beautiful and popular mountains.
      * The development of a new highway that will cut the trip from Seoul to Sokcho to just 1.5 hours.
  * Spread your investment over several properties. If one of your investments doesn&#8217;t work out, your broader portfolio will not be significantly impacted. When compared to, say, Gangnam in Seoul, Sokcho property prices are low&#8211;property prices are closer in value to their intrinsic value, helping to dissipate risk in a depreciating market as property prices can only go down by so much. Also, you&#8217;re risking less of your own money in a single investment by investing in several cheaper properties as opposed to one or two more expensive properties.
  * Negotiate a discount to the asking price and buy below market value. Most of your profit is made on purchase.
  * Push the closing date out as much as possible. This will give you more time in which to find a jeonse tenant.
  * Work on your relationship with your real estate agent. If your real estate agent knows you have the ability to close on a deal, you may get unique access to properties before they even get listed. This ensures you get access to the best deals.
  * Invest in properties with a unique selling point. A unique selling point could be a great view, an elevator, a car park, or very low building maintenance fees.<figure style="width: 1466px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
